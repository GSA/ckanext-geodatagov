# Data.gov  

[Data.gov](http://data.gov) is an open data website created by the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://github.com/GSA/) that is based on two robust open source projects: [CKAN](http://ckan.org) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). The data catalog at [catalog.data.gov](catalog.data.gov) is powered by CKAN, while the content seen at [Data.gov](Data.gov) is powered by WordPress.  
        
**For all code, bugs, and feature requests related to Data.gov, see the project wide Data.gov [issue tracker](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/issues).** 

Currently this repository is only used for source version control on the code for the CKAN extension for geospatial data, but you can see all of the Data.gov relevant repos listed in the [GSA Data.gov README file](https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/blob/master/README.md). 

## CKAN Extension for Geospatial Data

Most Data.gov specific CKAN customizations are contained within this extension, but the extension also provides additional geospatial capabilities.

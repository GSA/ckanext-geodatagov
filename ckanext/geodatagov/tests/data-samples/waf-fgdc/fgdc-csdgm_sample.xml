         <abstract>The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) from The National Map (TNM) defines the
            perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics.
            The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as
            the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such
            as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into
            smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy,
            with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested
            into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins,
            Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to
            https://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. 
            
            The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a
            companion dataset to the WBD. The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data
            that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface
            water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches,
            streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells,
            stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes
            classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and
            related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the
            NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and
            transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream
            directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata
            that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is
            available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and
            referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and
            referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are
            available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as
            local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to
            https://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. 
            
            Hydrography data from The National Map supports many
            applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data
            maintenance, and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with other data
            themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce
            general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public
            domain WBD and NHD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase, or Shapefile
            formats.</abstract>
